# PlacerInPocketBalanceManagement

PROJECTGOAL: To manage the cash flow of VS placers to ensure that placers can be in play for the predetermined work time frame, to ensure placers do not hold excessive amounts of cash, to ensure qualified placers who have ‘blown’ their stake to be refloated. This supports the ‘Admin’ and ‘MI Dashboard’ dialogs of the WEB sub project.
